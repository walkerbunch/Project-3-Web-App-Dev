Web App Dev Project 3: Implementing an API

This web app uses React, JSX, and TheCocktailDB API to generate a random cocktail. There are currently no filtering options.
Every button-press or re-load of the page will yield a new drink.
The page displays the drink's name, an image, the ingredients, and instructions.
All content on the webpage pulls from the API except for the header, button, and accompanying text.
